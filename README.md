# Open Deep Research on Windows Powershell (without running Docker)

This project is based on dzhng's deep-search repository (https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research) project but in a much simpler way. 
And this was achievable purely with prompt engineering, command lining, and slight code modification.

# Tech Stack Breakdown

1. Programming Environment
Language: TypeScript / JavaScript (Node.js runtime)
Runtime: Node.js (required for executing scripts and managing dependencies)
Package Manager: npm (Node Package Manager)

2. External APIs & Services
API/Service
üîç Firecrawl API	Web search and content extraction (SERP results + markdown format)
üß† OpenAI API	LLM-powered query generation, research direction, summarization, reporting

3. LLM Functions
Uses LLMs (OpenAI) to:
Generate SERP queries from a user prompt
Extract structured learnings from search results
Create follow-up questions and next-step queries
Compile markdown reports and concise answers

# Implementation Steps

1. Create a project folder in your system
2. Open your Powershell and make sure node.js and git are installed
3. Connect Powershell to the project file (see "code" in deep-search page) and download the project package
     cd C:\path\to\your\desired\directory
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
4. Install necessary files in the project folder
     npm install
5. In the repository, change .env.example to .env.local and copy-paste OpenAI and Firecrawl's APIs.
6. Change model name from o3-mini to gpt-4o in provider.ts
7. Comment out "reasoning" line in provider.ts file in src folder
8. Run the program via Powershell
     npm start
9. Ask anything
